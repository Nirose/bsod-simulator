# Windows 10 BSOD Simulator (with AutoHotKey)
Just a small fun project to open an image of the Windows 10 BSOD screen in fullscreen on command.

### Shortcut

The default shortcut is the combination of `Left Windows Key + K`

To return, Press `Esc`

## Source code in AHK

`bsod.ahk`

- Running the ahk file makes it visible in the Windows taskbar. 
- Needs AutoHotKey installed

## Executable
`bsod.exe`

- Running the executable hides it in the taskbar but operational. 
- Use task manager to close it completely. 
- Doesn't require AutoHotKey installed
